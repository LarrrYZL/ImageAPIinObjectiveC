##Objective-C Examples for the Leap Motion Image API

This example demonstrates basic usage of the Leap Motion Image API in Objective-C. Examples include:

* Converting the raw sensor data into an NSImage object.
* Finding the pixel location corresponding to 3D locations.
* Using GLSL 4.10 shaders to apply the sensor calibration to the image.
* Finding the pixel location on the undistorted image corresponding to a 3D location.

**Note:** The LeapImage API has not been released as part of the Leap Motion SDK yet. You must use the ``LeapObjectiveC.h`` and ``LeapObjectiveC.mm`` files contained in this project. The LeapImage class will be added to the SDK in an upcoming release.
