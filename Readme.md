##Objective-C Examples for the Leap Motion Image API

This example demonstrates basic usage of the Leap Motion Image API in Objective-C. Examples include:

* Converting the raw sensor data into an NSImage object.
* Finding the pixel location corresponding to 3D locations.
* Using GLSL 4.10 shaders to apply the sensor calibration to the image.
* Finding the pixel location on the undistorted image corresponding to a 3D location.

The project assumes that your Leap Motion SDK is a peer to the project directory. (You can also drag the required code and library files from your SDK into the project directly.)
